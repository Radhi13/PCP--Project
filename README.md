# PCP--Project

•	First, we need to install python 3.5 and Django.
•	We also need to install Django Crispy forms by using the command pip as shown below. This will give a very elegant form.
		pip install django-crispy-forms
•	Extract the file from the zip file, ‘mysite_project’ folder will be created as shown below. 
•	Click the mysite_folder project and you will find a mysite folder which is our main directory 
•	The paradigm of Django is that either a website is an app, or a collection of apps in most cases.
We currently have our website, called "mysite". 
•	To run this app - Press shift and right click on the mysite folder and select option “open command window here”.
This will directly set the directory in the command prompt to mysite. 	
•	Run the following via the command line or terminal
		python manage.py runserver 
•	This runs the local development server, which you can reach at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
